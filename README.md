ABOUT
=====
The project was initiated by Jonathan Chiang (ADM-TW) and deligated to Maker's Club, aiming to deploy air quality sensors to Trend Micro's buildings to acquire real-time readings of,
- PM 2.5
- temperature
- humidity
- CO2 in ppm

We decided to use the following configuration,
- G3 PM 2.5 sensor (sold in Taobao)
- SHT31 I2C sensor (precise temperature + humidity)
- SenseAir S8 (CO2)
- Nokia 5110 LCD as indicator and debugger
- Extra LED as a chasis indicator
